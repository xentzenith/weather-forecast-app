warn - The `purge`/`content` options have changed in Tailwind CSS v3.0.       
warn - Update your configuration file to eliminate this warning.

warn - The `darkMode` option in your Tailwind CSS configuration is set to `false`, which now behaves the same as `media`.
warn - Change `darkMode` to `media` or remove it entirely.

One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your        
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.      

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to     
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message   
go away.

Compiled with warnings.

You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.
